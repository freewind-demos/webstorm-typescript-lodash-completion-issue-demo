Configuration Webstorm
----------------------

Install dependencies first:

```
npm install
```

Then add the `node_modules/@types/lodash` as a javascript library to current project:

![webstorm-lodash-work-1.jpg](./images/webstorm-lodash-work-1.jpg)

Choose the `node_modules/@types/lodash` directory of current project:

![webstorm-lodash-work-2.jpg](./images/webstorm-lodash-work-2.jpg)

Make sure the `lodash` library is added:

![webstorm-lodash-work-3.jpg](./images/webstorm-lodash-work-3.jpg)

Try:

![webstorm-lodash-work-4.jpg](./images/webstorm-lodash-work-4.jpg)

It also works if we import lodash as `_`:

![webstorm-lodash-work-as-underscore.jpg](./images/webstorm-lodash-work-as-underscore.jpg)

It works but we have to do this manually, which is quite boring.
